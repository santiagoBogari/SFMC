Hi %%=v(@fullname)=%%,

As we enjoy the remaining days of summer, its time to think about getting your vehicle ready for fall adventures and winter road trips. Now is a great time to check major components like tires, brakes and batteries to help give you confidence on the roads as the days get shorter and the weather begins to change.

Here are recommended services:
%%[
IF @servicesCount > 0 THEN
 FOR @counter = 1 to @servicesCount DO
   VAR @service, @serviceName, @serviceDescription
   SET @service = row(@services, @counter)
   SET @serviceName = field(@service,'Name')
   SET @serviceDescription = field(@service,'Description')
]%%

%%=v(@serviceName)=%% %%=v(@serviceDescription)=%%

%%[ 
NEXT @counter 
ELSE RaiseError('no rows found', true)
ENDIF 
]%%
